# AI Prompts Used

## Round 1: Initial Structure
**Prompt:** [paste your prompt]
**Result:** 
- What worked immediately
- What needed fixing
- What we learned

## Round 2: Feature Implementation
**Prompt:** I want to create a way to filter the content feed by creator. Can you use shad to see if this is possible? Can you use the view model?
**Result:** 
- What worked immediately: It was able to create a working filter.
- What needed fixing: It tried using Radix, but that caused problems with deployment, so now it uses a native control. In addition, I made edits to change how it appeared on the page.
- What we learned: AI needs more context regarding aesthetic choices. It still needs human creativity.
**Prompt:** I also want you to make a search feature that allows users to filter the content by the text in them. After you're done making it, integrate it with the content feed but place it above the filter by creator
**Result:** 
- What worked immediately: It made a working search feature in the location that I wanted it to.
- What needed fixing: Nothing. It worked on first try.
- What we learned: AI is really good at creating simple stuff.
